# Studying the influence of COVID-19 cases on media consumption across various video streaming platforms in the U.S.

My final project will analyze the correlation between COVID-19 case trends and streaming service usage across major platforms by examining data from before, during, and after the pandemic's peak years (2020-2023). The main research goal is to understand how a global crisis like COVID-19 influenced streaming and media consumption patterns over time. By using correlation and regression analysis, I hope to quantify and identify key patterns across different phases of the pandemic, especially relationships between COVID-19 cases and subscription counts. This study aims to provide insights into how a global crisis can change consumer behaviors in the context of digital media consumption.

Current datasets that I plan to use:
