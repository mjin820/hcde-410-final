**Studying the influence of COVID-19 cases on media consumption across various video streaming platforms in the U.S.**

My final project will analyze the correlation between COVID-19 case trends and streaming service usage across major platforms by examining data from before, during, and after the pandemic's peak years (2020-2023). The main research goal is to understand how a global crisis like COVID-19 influenced streaming and media consumption patterns over time. I will be using correlation and regression analysis to quantify and determine the relationship between COVID-19 case counts and streaming subscriptions, focusing on patterns across various phases of the pandemic.
